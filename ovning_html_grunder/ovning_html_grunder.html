        <H1>Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?</H1>

        <p><i>by William Shakespeare</i></p>

        <p>
            Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?                 <br />
            Thou art more <i>lovely</i> and more <b>temperate</b>:  <br />
            Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,           <br />
            And summer’s lease hath all too short a <sup>date</sup>:
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,          <br />
            And often is his gold complexion <sub>dimm’d</sub>, <br />
            And every fair from fair sometime declines,         <br />
            By chance, or nature’s changing course untrimm’d:
        </p>

        <p>
            But thy eternal summer shall not fade,              <br />
        Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,            <br />
            Nor shall death brag thou wander’st in his shade,   <br />
            When in eternal lines to time thou grow’st,         <br />
            So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,        <br />
            So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
        </p>
