        <h2>The Phoenix and the Turtle</h2>

            <p><em>By William Shakespeare</em></p>


            <p>Let the bird of loudest lay, <br />
                On the sole Arabian tree,<br />
                Herald sad and trumpet be,<br />
                To whose sound chaste wings obey.</p>

            <p>But thou shrieking harbinger,<br />
                Foul precurrer of the fiend,<br />
                Augur of the fever's end,<br />
                To this troop come thou not near!</p>

            <p>From this session interdict<br />
                Every fowl of tyrant wing,<br />
                Save the eagle, feather'd king:<br />
                Keep the obsequy so strict.</p>

            <p>Let the priest in surplice white,<br />
                That defunctive music can,<br />
                Be the death-divining swan,<br />
                Lest the requiem lack his right.</p>

            <p>And thou treble-dated crow,<br />
                That thy sable gender makest<br />
                With the breath thou givest and takest,<br />
                'Mongst our mourners shalt thou go.</p>

            <p>Here the anthem doth commence:<br />
                Love and constancy is dead;<br />
                Phoenix and the turtle fled<br />
                In a mutual flame from hence.</p>

            <p>So they loved, as love in twain<br />
                Had the essence but in one;<br />
                Two distincts, division none:<br />
                Number there in love was slain.</p>

            <p>Hearts remote, yet not asunder;<br />
                Distance, and no space was seen<br />
                'Twixt the turtle and his queen:<br />
                But in them it were a wonder.</p>

            <p>So between them love did shine,<br />
                That the turtle saw his right<br />
                Flaming in the phoenix' sight;<br />
                Either was the other's mine.</p>

            <p>Property was thus appalled,<br />
                That the self was not the same;<br />
                Single nature's double name<br />
                Neither two nor one was called.</p>

            <p>Reason, in itself confounded,<br />
                Saw division grow together,<br />
                To themselves yet either neither,<br />
                Simple were so well compounded,</p>

            <p>That it cried, How true a twain<br />
                Seemeth this concordant one!<br />
                Love hath reason, reason none,<br />
                If what parts can so remain.</p>

            <p>Whereupon it made this threne<br />
                To the phoenix and the dove,<br />
                Co-supremes and stars of love,<br />
                As chorus to their tragic scene.</p>

            <p>THRENOS.</p>

            <p>Beauty, truth, and rarity,<br />
                Grace in all simplicity,<br />
                Here enclosed in cinders lie.</p>

            <p>Death is now the phoenix' nest<br />
                And the turtle's loyal breast<br />
                To eternity doth rest,</p>

            <p>Leaving no posterity:<br />
                'Twas not their infirmity,<br />
                It was married chastity.</p>

            <p>Truth may seem, but cannot be:<br />
                Beauty brag, but 'tis not she;<br />
                Truth and beauty buried be.</p>

            <p>To this urn let those repair<br />
                That are either true or fair<br />
                For these dead birds sigh a prayer.</p>
